        I've decided to keep this little journal to document, hopefully in
        detail, the full process of making a game. I've also decided to write
        it in Python because I really like the language and haven't ever
        written a game in it. So here goes...
    <div class="section">The Idea</div>
        The Idea of the game is pretty simple (and a bit common). I haven't
        fleshed out all of the details, but in general it will be a pixelated
        RPG game with the civilizations having technology about as advanced
        as those in Skyrim. The more intriguing part of this game comes
        from its skill-learning mechanics. At least in Skyrim, the method
        of "learning" spells was just reading a book. I want to have
        a game where learning is much more continuous and much less discrete.
        So I sort of envision a mechanic (at least in regards to learning
        spells) where one can practice a spell, by hitting a series of keys,
        and the best spell the character achieves in practice is the one
        that will be used in battle.
        <br> <br>

        The specific mechanic of practicing spells is largely inspired by
        the energy (or chakra) system in Naruto. The idea is that every
        individual has a mana center/core, and they have a system of
        mana-carrying wires througout the body, as seen in the image. These
        wires are connected by gates which can be opened and closed by the
        player. These gates also correspond to elements, in order to use
        specific spells. For example, one could open a fire gate and then
        open a gate near their hands, and that could be a spell that shoots
        fire from their hands. The proper timing of when the energy arrives
        to a gate and when that gate is opened would factor in to how
        successful the spell was. The best/strongest spell used in training
        would be the one used in battle. That is the general idea of the
        spell-learning mechanic.
    <div class="section">The Style</div>
        A few months ago, when I was first beginning to thing about making this
        game, I drew up a few mockups of some sample tiles, that would be used
        <img src="../images/sample_map.png" id="sample_map" align="right">
        in the map. I had imagined a game with an isomorphic perspective, and
        where tiles could have different heights. The sample 4x4 map here
        gives a good visualization. I also did a bit of investigation into
        what the math would look like when projecting a map stored in data to
        one in this isometric style, and discovered that it is easier than
        I initially expected.
        <br><br>
        So, what we want to achieve is we want to project a map that is stored
        as a 2D array (list of lists in Python) onto, what looks like, a skewed
        plane.
        <img src="../images/array_to_map_.png" id="array_to_map">
        This doesn't end up being too difficult. I decided to use a 2D engine
        for this game, so what I have to work with are tiles like these
        <img src="../images/grass.png" id="grass" align="right">
        which are 32 pixels wide and 24 pixels tall. The general formula is,
        for a tile at row $r$ and column $c$, the coordinate of the tile
        in the rendered space is ($16(r-c), 8(r + c)$). The general idea is,
        when you move down a row in the array, you increase the $x-$coordinate
        by 16, and increase the $y-$coordinate by 8. When moving down a column,
        you still increase the $y-$coordinate by 8, but you decrease the
        $x-$coordinate by 16. Note: pygame has the $y-$axis
        increasing as you move down the screen.
    <div class="section">Where We Go From Here</div>
        That's about all I know on the mechanics of the game so far, and it
        will be fleshed out as I program the game. At the time of writing
        this, I have merely a small structure of code set up, with a
        <code>Game</code> class that controls the state of the game. I'm
        trying to get a general feel as to what classes I will need and
        what classes will control what. I'll have a new post once I figure
        that out.
